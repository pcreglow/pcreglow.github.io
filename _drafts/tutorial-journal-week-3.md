**Revised Brainstorm/Outline**

**Creating a new directory and moving files to it via Git**
 * Am I in the right repository?
 * How about a branch?
 * Create that directory! mkdir <name>
 * And the files? Locate first, then move via mv <file> <new location>
 * Git status, git add, git status, git commit
 * Git push and send those babies upstream! 

**Brainstorm/Outline**

**Utlizing command line and Git**
  * Beginner utilizing command line. I was intimidated at first, but practice showed improvement
  * Here is one process to help improve comfort level with command line and Git
  * How do I clone a repo locally?
  * Now that I have a repo, how do I create a new branch?
  * My branch is ready so how do I create a file in the new branch?
  * My file is created and I added code. What now?
  
   *  Git status
   *  Git add
   *  Git status
   *  Git commit
   
  * How do my changes show up in GitHub? Git push
