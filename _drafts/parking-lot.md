Working in groups! - The good, the bad & the ugly

 - Ugly: $25 pitcher of beer, loss of power, comfortable work space

Learning to love Git

- Overcoming intimidation - baby steps, then bigger steps, then a slow walk
- Try it once...then comeback for more! (Git status, git add, git status, git commit)

- Seeing TIY students - past & present - in the crowd
