**Reflective - Rough Draft**

Prior to starting at The Iron Yard, I perceived time differently. The calendar moved at a far slower pace. So slow that I had time to plan and readjust my schedule, often multiple times a day. I had an abundance of free time to process a course of action as the clock ticked along. Slow and steady.

Now? Time flies! This is this fast line. I am moving at warp speed. Looking right, left or in the rearview mirror for too long and you risk falling behind. It's not easy going this fast. We are taking the winding, curving road and the brakes aren't functional.

On occasion I lose focus and wonder if we are moving too fast. That's not a complaint, but a realization that when moving quickly it's easy to miss details. Can you only determine progress by moving forward? How do you know what you missed if you didn't see it?

I recognize progress from the implementation of HTML, CSS properties, and significant improvement in using Git. JavaScript remains as the landmark I missed while speeding by. I see an outline but want more time to study the details. Something is there but I often struggle to recreate it. Getting a starting point with the help of others gets me on the right path and I can fill in the details from there. Ultimately, I want to be in a position to start the journey and describe the landmark on my own.
