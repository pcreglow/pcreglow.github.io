**Rough Draft: Reflective Journal - Week 6**

Week six was all about the team, the TEAM, the T-E-A-M! Also known as group projects.

Going back to college, I have had a love-hate relationship with group projects. In college at least, I experienced more failure than success working in groups. This occurred primarily because of the multitude of distractions that drained the commitment level of team members, myself included.

Group projects in a professional setting were far more rewarding, as team members often had a singular focus to ensure accountability and high standards to maximize the potential for success.

Another reason I experienced success during group projects in a professional setting was continuity. I had developed a working relationship with team members over a long period of time. For the most part we knew each others strengths and weaknesses, resulting in better planning and execution of assigned tasks.

At the Iron Yard, I wasn't sure what to expect heading into the first group assignment? The college experience, since this is a short term program? Or the professional experience, since members of the cohort 60+ hours per week and are fully invested in the program?

Thankfully, my experience with the group project was a success and a rewarding experience. I worked with Jorge Hernandez and our assignment was to create a web application that would pull data from at least two APIs. Our plan was to create an application that was minimalist in style, and pull API data for weather, a news source and social media. Our final product not only met the requirements, but we achieved our goal by including live API data from OpenWeatherMap and Flickr, and cached data from the New York Times US news feed.

In working with Jorge, I learned a bit more about the importance of taking a break when a code feature was not successful. There were three instances where Jorge and I would take a break after hitting a wall, only to return to the task fifteen minutes later and find a solution to the problem. We achieved success working together and remotely, proving that feedback via multiple communication channels is a big advantage in a group project. Go team.
