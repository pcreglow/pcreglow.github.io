**The Iron Yard - Week 1**

If you think you are prepared for The Iron Yard, you aren't. If you think talent alone is going to bring you success at The Iron Yard, well, you have already failed. That's a good thing. Wait...what? 

How is failure a good thing? I asked the same question and began to figure out why during our first assignment at The Iron Yard. The assignment required research and a written essay about a [growth vs. fixed mindset](http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/). It didn't take long to learn that in a growth mindset, failure can lead to growth, knowledge, and the development of new skill sets. To sustain the growth mindset, you have to embrace challenges and place yourself in unconformable situations. 

So, about that first week of assignments, where it’s likely the instructor will go easy on everyone and just glide peacefully into the class, right? Think again. There was failure and mistakes galore. Want to feel really uncomfortable? Try having your homework reviewed in front of the entire class (Yeah, that happened). The upside is by stepping outside of my comfort zone and participating in peer review of my homework, I saw my own mistakes and could process ways to improve for next time. You also see the mistakes of others, so why not take the opportunity to learn from their mistakes as well? That's a good idea. 

Who knew that simplest is best, especially when dealing with technical coding languages and programming? Not me. Not until I learned why at The Iron Yard. An early lecture referenced the three principles of (XP) [Extreme Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices): Simplest is best, don't over complicate, once and only once. Initially that is a hard concept to grasp. The initial instinct is overthink every concept, every process. There are so many shiny objects. I want to understand them all, but not yet. As the instructor reminded us, take baby steps! Now that is sound advice. Rome wasn’t built in a day, nor is my understanding of Git and JavaScript. 

My first week at The Iron Yard has been overwhelming, exciting, tiring, fun, unnerving, and productive. Now moving on to week two.
