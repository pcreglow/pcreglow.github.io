<p>This isn’t a code tutorial, but a worthwhile reminder about how to view progress and success. The Long Game is a short, two-part, video series about how we view success in relation to the life and work of Leonardo de Vinci. Now we view him as a genius and one of the great artists the world has ever known, but his story isn’t that simple.</p>

<p>My highest recommendation for this video series and what this message can mean for own creative journey in life, and how we perceive our own success and failure.</p>
