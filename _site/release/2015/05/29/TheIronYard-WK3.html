<p><strong>The Iron Yard - Week 3</strong></p>

<p>Week three at The Iron Yard was the proverbial change of pace. A time where the workload didn’t stay the same - it increased - and the cohort was introduced to a new way of thinking about front end development and it’s application in the real world. Hello field trip! Last week we attended <a href="http://frontenddesignconference.com/">The Front End Design Conference</a> in St. Petersburg, FL, a two day conference featuring a wide range of speakers with backgrounds in design, development, and team management.</p>

<p>Team work was a central themes throughout the conference and the presentations really struck a cord with me during the Friday sessions. It’s easy to get lost in your own little world, and as an introvert, I often can slip into the habit of staying in a silo to accomplish a task or work assignment without soliciting feedback or assistance from others. Over the years, this has been a bad habit of mine and I was relieved to hear so many speakers reveal ways to overcome it. In particular, Wren Lanier’s presentation - <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ModevHQ/wlanier-slides">How Designers Fail</a> - focused on common failures in communication and teamwork for designers and developers. The risk of failure can be avoided by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A focus on learning and make it a part of every day</li>
  <li>Be transparent by sharing your work in progress early and often</li>
  <li>Put conversation with team members and clients at the center of your process</li>
</ul>

<p>In the last week, a core elemet of our homework assignments has been peer review. This had primarily been a part of journal entries, like this one, and  the always comfortable homework review in front of the cohort. After attending the conference and hearing about so many examples of team work and its importance, I have a better understanding as to why The Iron Yard includes peer review early and often during our cohort. Once we are released to the real world, our abilties and knowledge as developers will only go so far. Team work is critical to our success. Failure won’t be kind to introverts.</p>
