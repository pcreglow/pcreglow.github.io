<p><strong>A Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</strong></p>

<p>Mindset is defined as a mood, assumption, or attitude. To enhance our understanding of mindset, Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck conducted research to determine how our beliefs, attitudes, and personality traits impact our lives. Through Dweck’s research, our mindset - conscious or unconscious - relates to our ability to gain knowledge, utilize our talents, and expand our skill sets. This process begins by defining two mindsets: growth and fixed.</p>

<p>The growth mindset tells us that our intelligence, talent and ability can be developed and improved by embracing challenges. We embrace challenges by accepting failure, then realzing that failure does not limit our ability to succeed. Through failure and persistance, we continue to build a base of knowledge and experience that helps us overcome barriers to success. We grow to achieve, hence, the “growth” mindset.  Conversely, the fixed mindset tells us that our intellgience, talent and ability can’t be developed. We accept the status quo and avoid challenges so as not to encounter failure. We accept that we are stuck with our level of intelligence and skill sets, hence, a “fixed” mindset.  The mindsets compete in our lives and, upon reflection, show up in various experiences and outcomes.</p>

<p>My own growth vs. fixed mindset examples reference my perceptions of knowledge, position, and achievement in a professional environment. My growth mindset is drawn from my experience upon joining a state trade associaiton right after college. As a new employee, I had very little knowledge or understanding of my environment, but did bring a high level of energy and willingness to learn. I was able to overcome an initial lack of confidence and inexperience by being aggreesive in attempting unfamiliar tasks. I embraced stepping out of my comfort zone. My inexperience was the fuel for establishing a strong work ethic. By accepting that I would fail many times, I was able to learn quickly from mistakes, and sense a growth in confidence and ability.</p>

<p>Specifically, mistakes turned into growth and success via four activities: writing, public speaking, mentorship, and reputation. My job description required consistent participating in writing projects that would be published in various association publications and communication channels. This work had to be reviewed by superiors and would eventually be viewed by the public. Early mistakes became smaller and smaller overtime, thus giving me the confidence to produce content covering more advanced subject matters. A similar scenario developed after I began to take on challenges with public speaking, present information, and answer member questions in front of an audience. I had to step out of the comfort zone behind my desk and take on these public speaking challenges. I began to realize that my presentations improved over time from self reflection and a willingness to accept feedback from others. Mentorship is directly tied to feedback. Starting with little experience, I knew I didn’t have all the answers and had to be willing to seek guidance and constructive criticism. I opened my mind to new ways of accomplishing tasks. Finally, I didn’t want my low-level job title to define how I was perceived by others. I had set a goal to establish a reputation for being reliable and a hard worker. I wanted members and colleagues to know me by my name and work product, not my job title. Overall, this “growth” mindset resulted in the most rewarding time in my career and a high confidence level I had never felt before .</p>

<p>Advancing through my career timeline, the fixed mindset example appears. In early 2012 I was almost a full year into my latest position with a national trade associaiton. At that time, I had a resume which featured eight years of professional experience. With that resume and position came significant income and benefits. My job requirements were easy and offered minimal challenges. Right or wrong, the office culture adheared to a stay-in-your-lane mentality in order to avoid conflict. I was content. I had accepted my position with the association and fell into a safe zone.</p>

<p>I am not sure that being content or staying in a safe zone is always a bad thing, yet in the context of this fixed mindset example, I was unhappy with being content. Why? My work product received positice reviews, but I didn’t like the work. Why? The simplest answer was that I wasn’t being challenged. By constantly staying in my safe zone, I didn’t push and strive for challenges to improve my skill set and expand my knowledge. Over time, I would stear away from conflict in the office and avoided exposure to potential failures. Even worse, I rarely utilized the knowledge and skill sets I developed during my growth mindset.  By late 2014, I had reached a breaking point. Sensing no growth in my career and work product, my perception was that this resume that now featured ten years of professional experience had become stale. My fixed mindset had taken hold.</p>

<p>By choosing The Iron Yard, I am leaving my fixed mindset. I am seeking to challenge myself to open doors in a new field that I am interested in and want to explore further. I want to be free of fears about failure and accept - as I did in 2004 - that failures can and will turn into knowledge and growth. How rewarding that I have already experienced this during the first week of class!. Ultimately, I believe that hard work and a willingness to enter into uncomfortable situations or attempt challenging tasks will bring back my growth mindset. I have proven it. It’s time to do it again.</p>
